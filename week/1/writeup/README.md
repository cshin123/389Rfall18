### Part 2 (75 pts)

Despite your position in the company as a junior developer, you still have a responsibility to make a positive 
improvement within the company where you see fit. Therefore, informing the boss first would be the most ideal form 
of action because the boss will be able to allocate the resources to solve the issue. This is not a problem that you can 
solve by yourself, so it is the boss’s responsibility to create the team and manage the situation. Telling the 
public and the consumer watchdog of this issue would be dangerous because you are letting potential hackers know 
the vulnerabilities of the system. If you noticed these issues, then these security problems have probably been 
around for a while and there were no consequences. Therefore, if you let the public know, then this may spark 
potential hacks that would damage the car or endanger its occupants. If the company is unwilling to postpone the 
ECU’s release, then there is nothing more that you can do. Solving these issues would require more management power 
than one junior developer. Your responsibility is to find these issues and to fix them if you can or report them, 
then after you reported these complex security issues, it is the company’s responsibility to fix it. However, some 
may argue that you can go to the public and let people know, so they can outrage on social media and pressure the 
company to fix these issues, but you have a job to maintain. By going public you may risk your job and you are going 
to be heavily pressured to find a new job. Therefore, by informing the company of these issues you have done your job 
correctly, and if the company refuses to make changes then they risk the consequences. Also, if you do nothing then you 
do have some responsibility for any harm that results because you knew of these issues and you chose to not inform 
anybody. Your job is to audit the firmware for security issues, so by you not telling anybody and doing nothing, you 
are not doing your job correctly.
